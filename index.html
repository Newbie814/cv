      I have been a trainer for two plus decades. Professonally for 10 years.
      Currently, I am disillusioned with the lack of knowledge in the industry
      and marketing that is largely predicated upon ignorance, deception, or
      both. I am learning coding as a new challenge and a potential path to
      provide my wife and sons with a better, more stable, life.
